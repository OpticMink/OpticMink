- Greetings Internet dwellers, I am called Mink. (Or Opti.)
- Big fan of anthropomorphic animals. (Furry)
- Hopefully one of the nicest people you'll meet.
- Please don't kill me.
- I like the standard console and PC video games as well as those offered by virtual reality systems.
- Kind of a geek in some fields. (Sorry.)
- I like talking to people.
- I hate talking to Undertale/Deltarune fanboys/girls. (Like seriously, the game is dead. Get over it, it wasn't even all that.)
- Since this is the 9th entry in this bio, I should mention that one of my top 10 numbers is 9. (The others being: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 0.)
- Do not recommend a story game that doesn't have violence. I will not play it.
- FPS games fan. (Not that good at them though.)
- End of bio. (Goodbye!)
